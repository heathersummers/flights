`flights`
========

This is an R package that provides functions that give more information on flights. The goal of flights is to provide additional functions for analyzing the `nycflights13` data package.

Installation
------------

You can install flights from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("heathersummers/flights")
```

Example
-------
See the vignette for more extensive use, but here are a few basic examples:

```{r example}
flights::milestokm(150)
flights::fuel(250)
flights::arrivaldelay(60)
flights::departuredelay(130)
```

For Developers
--------------
This package provides functions that would be very helpful when using the `nycflights13` package.
